    <h1>Actor Jeff Ryan Begs Wes Anderson and Steve Carell for Pictures to Impress High School Ex's</h1>

    <p><strong>LOS ANGELES, CA —</strong> In an alleged attempt to "win the break-up" years too late, underground filmmaker and self-identified multi-hyphenate Jeff Ryan was seen circulating images of himself with acclaimed director Wes Anderson and beloved actor Steve Carell at a private industry-adjacent rave in East LA.</p>

    <p>According to attendees, Ryan — who has written, directed, starred in, edited, and, reportedly, sang the credits theme for his upcoming film <em>Mooch</em> — was “hovering by the DJ booth with a Walgreens envelope,” casually sliding out 4x6 prints of himself alongside the two Hollywood icons.</p>

    <blockquote>
      “It was like watching someone audition for friendship,” said one source, who asked to remain anonymous but wore fingerless gloves. “He was saying things like, ‘Steve and I had a real moment,’ and, ‘Wes told me I give off Grand Budapest energy.’ It was a bad look.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>Anderson and Carell have not commented on the incident. Publicists for both declined requests for clarification and responded with a simple, “Who?”</p>

    <p>Witnesses described the vibe of the event as “lo-fi chaos,” and said the interaction felt less like a networking opportunity and more like someone “trying to create a scrapbook in real time.” One guest noted that Ryan was overheard asking Carell to "pose like it’s 2005," presumably referencing a time when Ryan still had a MySpace band page and a flip phone.</p>

    <blockquote>
      “He wasn’t even subtle,” another attendee said. “He tried to get someone to take a Polaroid of him ‘pretending to take a call from Greta Gerwig.’”
    </blockquote>

    <p>It remains unclear if the celebrities were even aware of who Ryan was or why he was showing them a poster for <em>Mooch</em> while asking if they “needed an extra for anything upcoming.”</p>

    <p>The film community has long speculated that Ryan’s greatest skill may be unearned confidence — a theory he appears committed to proving correct. As for the high school ex? She could not be reached for comment but has since liked a post by someone named Derek with a boat.</p>
