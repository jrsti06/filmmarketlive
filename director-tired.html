    <h1>Director Says Film Was Inspired by a Dream, Then Admits He Was Just Tired</h1>

    <p><strong>LOS ANGELES, CA —</strong> At a post-screening Q&A hosted in the back room of a vape shop/art gallery, <em>Mooch</em> director Jeff Ryan initially claimed the concept for his film came to him in a vivid, cinematic dream.</p>

    <p>"It was like… color, light, sound… but metaphorical, you know?" said Ryan, sipping a yerba mate and looking deeply into the middle distance.</p>

    <p>However, within minutes — and after two follow-up questions — Ryan pivoted.</p>

    <blockquote>
      “Okay fine,” he confessed. “I wasn’t dreaming. I had just pulled an all-nighter editing a TikTok about soup and nodded off on the spacebar. Next thing I knew I had a script.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>Eyewitnesses say the crowd didn’t mind the lack of mysticism.</p>

    <p>“I respect the honesty,” one attendee said. “Most directors lie to make their movie seem deeper. Jeff just seemed confused and dehydrated.”</p>

    <p>As of press time, Ryan was reportedly seen Googling “how to lucid dream on purpose” while whispering “Christopher Nolan would never.”</p>
