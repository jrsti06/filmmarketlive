      <h1>'Mooch' Set to Premiere at Rejecta — Sources Call It a Cry for Help in Feature Film Form</h1>
      <p>
        Described by its creators as "a chaotic blend of emo, ego, and existential dread," <strong>Mooch</strong>
        will make its world debut at <strong>Rejecta Film Festival</strong>, likely in front of an audience of confused tourists
        and emotionally exhausted filmmakers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early press screenings have elicited laughter, cringing, and more than one audible gasp from attendees who
        couldn't tell whether the film was satire or sincere melodrama. Director and star <strong>Jeff Ryan</strong> has claimed it's both,
        which hasn't helped anyone understand it better.

        The film, which follows an emotionally unstable man-child on a self-destructive quest for love and relevance,
        was rejected by every major film festival on the circuit. One programmer (anonymously) called it “too honest.”
        Others called it “surprisingly well-lit.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Mooch will premiere Sunday, June 8th at 4PM EST in a questionable venue directly across from the Tribeca red carpet.
        Free seltzer and stale candy will be provided while supplies last.
