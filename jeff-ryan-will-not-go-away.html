          <h1>Multi-Hyphenate Jeff Ryan Will Not Go Away (Even If You Want Him To)</h1>
          <p><strong>Four indie films, one fake film festival, and a relentless pursuit of becoming Hollywood’s next offbeat leading man. Resistance is futile.</strong></p>

          <hr>

          <p><strong>NEW YORK —</strong> There are some actors who wait patiently for Hollywood to discover them. And then there’s <strong>Jeff Ryan</strong> — an indie multi-hyphenate who refuses to sit still, be quiet, or fade politely into obscurity.</p>

          <p>With four self-produced feature films under his belt — all with him in the lead — and a growing stack of viral stunts to his name (including launching the recent <strong>Rejecta Film Festival</strong>… in a van parked outside Tribeca), Ryan is doing what he does best: forcing the world to notice.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Relentless One</h2>

          <p>Over the last five years, Ryan has written, directed, and starred in four features — three of which are currently streaming. His latest, <em>MOOCH</em>, is a darkly funny, lo-fi noir about a New Jersey caddy turned private investigator, releasing this fall.</p>

          <p>In June, frustrated by a lack of traditional festival traction, Ryan created his own fake film festival — <strong>Rejecta</strong> — screening <em>MOOCH</em> out of a white 15-passenger van in front of Tribeca’s Village East Cinema. The resulting video — part stunt, part sincere call to arms for indie filmmakers — quickly made the rounds online.</p>

          <h2>The Actor You Can’t Ignore</h2>

          <p>Known for his self-deprecating humor, deadpan timing, and off-kilter charm, Ryan is often described as “if Benny Safdie, Robert Pattinson, and Andrew Garfield’s awkward cousin tried really hard.”</p>

          <p>He’s played everything from earnest romantic leads to jittery noir weirdos, and frequently draws comparisons to <em>“the kind of actor you’d like to see be cast in <strong>White Lotus</strong> (his words, not ours).”</em></p>

          <p>And yes — he’s seeking theatrical and commercial representation.</p>
