    <h1>Mooch Tries to Sell Mortgage-Backed Securities, But Can’t Get a Loan</h1>

    <p><strong>NEW YORK, NY —</strong> In what critics are calling both “a bold satire of capitalism” and “a deeply flawed understanding of economics,” the lead character in the indie film <em>Mooch</em> attempts to offload mortgage-backed securities despite being unable to secure a basic home loan himself.</p>

    <p>“The whole scene was inspired by watching one too many 2008 crash documentaries while broke,” said director Jeff Ryan, who confirmed the character doesn’t own property, collateral, or pants without holes.</p>

    <blockquote>
      “It’s not about actually owning the debt,” said Ryan. “It’s about selling the idea of the debt. That’s cinema.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>Sources close to the production say the character pitched his MBS bundle to a local bank using a printed PowerPoint and vibes alone. The bank manager reportedly replied, “I’m calling someone,” and left the room. He never returned.</p>

    <p>Despite the financial rejection, the scene is being hailed by film school students as “post-economic realism.” Mooch, for his part, continues to live rent-free in both the narrative and his friend’s spare room.</p>
