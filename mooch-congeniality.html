    <h1>'Mooch' Wins Miss Congeniality at IFFBoston's Bowling Night</h1>

    <p><strong>BOSTON, MA —</strong> While the critically-acclaimed Mooch walked away empty-handed in the formal competition at the Independent Film Festival Boston (IFFBoston), the cast and crew refused to go quietly. Instead, they rolled a different kind of strike at the festival’s annual bowling night — and were awarded an unofficial but spirited honor: <strong>Miss Congeniality.</strong></p>

    <p>The team, clad in matching thrifted bowling shirts emblazoned with the words "Gutterly Rejected," took over the lanes with enthusiasm that some described as inspiring and others as "mildly unsafe." One strike was celebrated with a choreographed group hug that took out two innocent bystanders and a mozzarella stick tray.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "It wasn’t about the pins, it was about the vibes," said director-star Jeff Ryan. "We came here to win hearts, and maybe one plastic trophy. We got both."
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Miss Congeniality award, spray-painted onto a spare bowling pin and handed over with zero ceremony, now resides on the dashboard of the Mooch crew’s minivan. The filmmakers say it means more than any laurel or distribution deal.</p>

    <p>Festival organizers were quick to clarify that the award is not officially sanctioned — but they admit it may become an annual tradition. “There’s something to be said for joyful chaos,” said one programmer, “and they brought it in droves.”</p>
